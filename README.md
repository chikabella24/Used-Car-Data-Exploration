## Used Car Data Exploration
 The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com. It is  about an automobile company XYZ from India which aspires to enter the Indian used-car market by setting up their company locally to give competition to their counterparts.
 
 They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the market, since those may be very different from the new car market. Essentially, the company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a used car?
This project has two main parts

In Part I, 
 During the data wrangling process i systematically explored the dataset to get information about the dataset, missing values, and duplicates in  which there none were  present. Then i used the python visualization libraries to  systematically explore this dataset(consists of information regarding 7906 obsevations by the Used Car Data with 18 attributes columns), starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

 The Used Car Data consists of 7906 observations and 18 features('Sales_ID','name','year','selling_price','km_driven','Region','State or Province',''City','fuel',seller_type','transmission','owner','mileage','engine','max_power','torque','seats','sold'.
 In Part II,
Explanatory data visualization, i produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that were discovered in my dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings were through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.



## Summary of Findings
 Among many features it can be said that Name, Region,owner, fuel types  are categories which affect buying and selling of car.

 Fuel feature  the diesel type, does predict the price of the car but it has no significat relation to its being sold and unsold

 The Transmission Mode, the Manual has a high significant relation to selling price and sold than the Automatic,and thus can predict the price     the car

 Mileage and Km_Driven doesn't affect price,it can be observed that cars with mileage close to 30 are being sold compared to cars with low  mileage and most of the cars have not been driven for long and that could also be factor why they dont command a high price.

 Most of the used_car were unsold from 1995 to 2010. From 2010 to 2020 there was an increase of sales and price

 Most of the used cars are on first owner basis and this commands a high selling price compare to the others. and most of first owner basis are sold more this could be a good determing factor for price


> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.


## Key Insights for Presentation
For this presentation i will describe how which variables are significant in predicting the price of a used car?
1.How well those variables describe the price of a car?
2.Which brands are selling most?
3.Are there specific locations selling more?
4.Which factors are more important in deciding cars' selling price? Ex. kms driven or type of owner or fuel type?
